# When the auction is successful

An auction is successful if bids exceed the minimum raised amount set for the auction. Sales can be collected by clicking 'Collect ETH' from the owner menu on the auction details page. A platform fee of 1% will be deducted from the sales. An initial user reward score is awarded to the auction organiser based on the amount of sales at the time of sales withdrawal.


&#x20;If the token allocation for the minimum bid is 0 (auctions that may have generated refundable bids), there is a 3-day waiting period until sales are collected as a refund request period.
