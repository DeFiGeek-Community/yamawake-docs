A list of auctions you have participated in is displayed at the bottom of the dashpod. Select an auction from the list and navigate to the details screen.

If the auction was successful, your allocated amount will be displayed in the Allocated Token Amount at the bottom of the Auction Details screen. If your allocated amount is not zero, you can get your tokens by clicking on the 'Claim' button (the button framed in red in the image below). If your allocated amount is 0, you have 3 days after the auction ends to collect your ETH (Templete V1 is designed so that cases of zero allocated amount rarely occur).

When the button display changes to 'Claimed', the claim is complete.  

Please check that the token has been claimed to your wallet.
